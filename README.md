# Hi there! 👋 I'm Aakanksha Chourasiya

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a **Business Analyst** passionate about transforming data into insights and helping organizations make smarter, data-driven decisions.

## 💼 About Me

I specialize in analyzing business processes, extracting actionable insights from data, and creating visualizations that help stakeholders see the full picture. With a Master's in **Business Analysis** and hands-on experience in tools like Excel, SQL, and Power BI, I bring both analytical depth and storytelling clarity to every project.

> 🎓 Fun fact: I started my academic journey with a Bachelor's in **Fashion Technology** — a foundation that taught me creativity, precision, and how to balance both logic and aesthetics. Now I apply that same mindset to solving business challenges with data.
